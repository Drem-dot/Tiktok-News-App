## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Dynamic Vertical Feed:** An immersive, full-screen vertical feed built with `ViewPager2` for seamless article browsing.
- **AI-Powered Summaries:** Before you even read, get a one-sentence, catchy summary of each article, generated on-the-fly by the **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash model**.
- **Content-Based Recommendation Engine:** The app learns from your behavior!
  - When you **Like ‚ù§Ô∏è** an article, the app analyzes its title, extracts keywords, and increases their relevance score in a local Room database.
  - The main feed is then algorithmically re-ranked to prioritize content matching your highest-scored keywords.
- **Save & Read Later:** Bookmark interesting articles with a single tap. All saved articles are neatly organized in a separate library screen for easy access.
- **Seamless In-App Reading:** Open the original article in a fully integrated `WebView`, ensuring a smooth reading experience without ever leaving the app.

- **Language:** **Java**
- **Architecture:** Client-side architecture with a focus on separating concerns.
  - **UI Layer:** XML with Material Design Components.
